description: Seed a new idea into the TaskStore as Inception (interactive intake → pending entry + inbox brief)
---

Act as **Inception** (`.harness/agents/inception.md`). That role file is the durable
contract; this command carries the interactive front-end. Resolve all relative paths
against `.harness/`.

The free-text idea is in `$ARGUMENTS`. If it is empty, ask the human for it.

1. Run `.harness/init.sh`. If it exits non-zero, STOP and report — do not seed into a
   broken environment.
2. Read `.harness/harness.config.yaml` and the TaskStore (`.harness/state/tasks.json`,
   per `.harness/store/local.md`).
3. Run a short, **adaptive** Q&A with the human to clarify: the problem and who it is
   for, the success outcome, the scope/boundaries, and any constraints. Where the
   shape forks, offer **at most 3** options as **text-only** (markdown/ASCII) mockups
   — never images. Keep it short; ask only what you need to triage and brief.
4. **Triage** the idea to exactly one altitude, per `.harness/agents/inception.md`:
   (1) new task on an existing feature / (2) new feature under an existing
   epic / (3) new epic + `epic.md` + `F01`. The write step is **altitude-dependent** —
   fork here. For altitudes 2 and 3, **allocate** a next-sequential id; for altitude 1,
   do NOT allocate a new id (you reuse the existing feature's id).
5. **Write** — branch by altitude:
   - **Altitude 1 (new task on an existing feature):** do NOT allocate a new id and do
     NOT insert a new feature into `.harness/state/tasks.json`. Branch on the existing
     feature's status (the inbox brief is read by the Architect only while a feature
     is `pending`):
     - **If it is still `pending`:** **append** a task-level note (and any dependency)
       to the EXISTING feature's `.harness/progress/inbox/<existing-feature-id>.md`
       brief — creating that brief from the `.harness/specs/_templates/inbox-brief.md`
       template if the feature predates the inbox convention. Per
       `.harness/agents/inception.md`, do not invent a competing feature. Then skip to
       step 8 (steps 6–7 cover only the new-entry path).
     - **If it is already `spec-ready`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, or `done`:** do
       NOT append to the brief — it has already been consumed, so the note would be a
       silent no-op. STOP and tell the human the addition must go back through
       specification: either raise it with the Architect to re-spec / update that
       feature's spec & task list, or re-run `/sdd-new` to seed it as a NEW feature
       (altitude 2) that `depends_on` the existing one. Do not write a no-op note.
   - **Altitudes 2 & 3:** write the `pending` feature entry into
     `.harness/state/tasks.json` (and, for a new epic, the epic entry +
     `.harness/specs/epics/<slug>/epic.md` + first `F01`), then continue to steps 6–7.
6. **Re-validate** `.harness/state/tasks.json` against
   `.harness/store/tasks.schema.json` (altitudes 2 & 3, after the new entry). If it
   fails, report the failure and do NOT claim a successful seed.
7. **Write** the intent brief to `.harness/progress/inbox/<feature-id>.md` (frontmatter
   + sections), copying `.harness/specs/_templates/inbox-brief.md` as the template.
8. **Report** the `<feature-id>` (for altitude 1, the EXISTING feature's id), the
   relevant `.harness/state/tasks.json` entry, the
   `.harness/progress/inbox/<feature-id>.md` path, and tell the human to **run
   `/sdd-next`** next. Do NOT spawn the Architect and do NOT change any status —
   Inception seeds, never specs, and never moves a feature past `pending`.
